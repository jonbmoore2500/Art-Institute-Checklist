# AIC Must-See

The AIC Must-See app lets users search for, preview, and then add to a checklist artworks they would like to see at the world-renowned Art Institute of Chicago (AIC).
Visit the AIC's website here: [https://www.artic.edu/]

After the user enters a search term, the app lists up to 40 relevant artworks that the AIC has access to. Mousing over any of those results displays additional information about the work in the middle preview section, along with either a button to add the work to the must-see list or a notification that the work is not currently on display. If the user sees a work they are interested in, they can click the button in the preview section to add that work to the must-see list, along with the gallery location of that work to make finding it in the museum a breeze. Don't worry about accidentally adding duplicates to the must-see list, the app automatically prevents that.

## Roadmap
I would like to add certain extra features:
 - Display sample images of the works in the preview section. The API contains this necessary info, so once I build a backend to store the images I can add it.
 - Have a switch to toggle on/off only searching for works in the public domain.
 - Have a switch to toggle on/off displaying search results that are not on display in addition to those that are. 
 - Sort the works in the results section alphabetically.
 - Sort the works in the must-see section either alphabetically or by Gallery #.
